# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform. Its importance lies in ensuring clarity and understanding of stakeholder expectations, which helps reduce ambiguity. It also clearly defines the project scope, preventing scope creep and keeping the project focused. By providing a solid foundation for system design and development, it guides the technical process effectively. Furthermore, it enables accurate estimation of cost, resources, and timelines. Ultimately, it supports quality assurance by ensuring the final product meets specified requirements, resulting in higher customer satisfaction.
